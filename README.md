# Diffusion Limited Aggregation
Many attractive images and life-like structures can be generated using models of physical processes from areas of chemistry and
physics. One such example is diffusion limited
aggregation or DLA which describes, among
other things, the diffusion and aggregation of
zinc ions in an electrolytic solution onto electrodes. "Diffusion" because the particles forming the structure wander around randomly before attaching themselves ("Aggregating") to
the structure. "Diffusion-limited" because the
particles are considered to be in low concentrations so they don’t come in contact with
each other and the structure grows one particle at a time rather then by chunks of particles. Other examples can be found in coral
growth, the path taken by lightning, coalescing
of dust or smoke particles, and the growth of
some crystals. Perhaps the first serious study
of such processes was made by Witten, T.A.
and Sander, L. M. and published by them in
1981.

To reproduce the experiments in notebooks, we suggest using the notebook `./experiment.ipynb` and tuning the parameters inside the source code `./DLA.c` for different experiments. For more details, please follow the section below.

## Guidelines 

1. Upload all folders and files of this repository into Google Drive.
2. Open the notebook `experiment.ipynb`.
3. At the second cell where you may see the command:
   ```
   %cd "/content/drive/MyDrive/<path to uploaded repo>"
   ```
   Change the `<path to uploaded repo>` into the path of the folder that contains your uploaded files and folders in Google Drive.
4. Run sequentially the notebook.
5. Results are shown at the last cell and saved to the folder `./output`.
